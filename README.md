# Discrete Event Systems
Simplified industrial plants are modelled as finite state machines and implemented on Raspberry Pi using Python. Logic controllers are designed for these plants and implemented on Arduino UNO. An alternative implementation of the Logic Controllers as PLCs is also carried out using openPLC.
