## Controllers- Implementation

After [verifying](../validation_and_verification) [controller design](../design), the controller is realized in two different forms:  

1- As C code compiled and run on an Atmel AVR ATMega328P board using the FSA model.  
2- As PLC code based on the SIPN model and implemented on a makeshift PLC system using OpenPLC.
