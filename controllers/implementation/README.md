## Controllers- Implementation

After [verifying](../validation_and_verification) [controller design](../design), the controller is realized in two different forms:  

1- As [C code](./atmega328p) compiled and run on an Atmel AVR ATMega328P board using the FSA model.  
2- As [PLC code](./OpenPLC) based on the SIPN model and implemented on a makeshift PLC system using OpenPLC.
